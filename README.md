# simple-user-list
The purpose of this repo is to expore the differences in various web technologies by implementing the same basic app in a variety of technologies.  The app is relatively simple but is broken up into small pieces in order to explore component communication and file organization.

The application accepts a few search inputs and then will call the [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/) API to retrieve fake user data given the search data.


## App Structure
Below is a block diagram showing the makeup of each component.
